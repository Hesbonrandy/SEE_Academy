# Fun Calculator ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator** â€” your simple and playful tool to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers like a boss! ðŸ˜Ž

## Features

- Takes two numbers as input (decimals allowed!).
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Displays results for all four operations.
- Lightweight and super easy to use.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the first number when prompted (decimals work fine!).
3. Enter the second number.
4. The program will calculate and display:
   - Sum (addition)
   - Difference (subtraction)
   - Product (multiplication)
   - Quotient (division)

## Notes

- The program assumes the second number is **not zero** when dividing. Dividing by zero will cause an error.
- The inputs accept decimal numbers using `float()` conversion.

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 8.5
Enter the second number: 2

Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 10.5
Difference: 6.5
Product: 17.0
Quotient: 4.25
```
